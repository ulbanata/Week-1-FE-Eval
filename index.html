	      <h2>Improving Your Radio's Reception</h2>
	      <p>From time to time, we receive a request from a listener asking what can be done to improve their reception of our FM signal. While the specific recommendations will vary, the following are some generalizations which may help if you are experiencing reception difficulty.</p>
	      <p>It must be remembered that the process of delivering sound from a radio studio to your ears involves a complete system. This includes the station's transmitter and antenna, the listener's receiver and antenna and the transmission path between the two. This last is important because if there is a mountain between the transmitter and receiver, there is nothing that can be done to provide good reception.</p>

	      <p>WLNT's transmitting system is maximized to operate at the maximum allowed power and to deliver the best signal over our licensed area(s). Steps to improving your reception should start with your antenna. If your receiver is a stereo component or console, there should be a pair of screw terminals on the back marked "FM antenna" or something similar.  If nothing is connected to these terminals, you need an antenna!!!   An antenna may be as simple as an inexpensive "twin-lead dipole" which can be purchased at most electronic or builder's supply stores. This will only be effective in the primary coverage area of the station, about 12 miles or so from the transmitter.  A 3-4 foot piece of speaker wire is better than nothing.  Ordinary TV "rabbit ears" will work reasonably well in this area as well.  For fringe-area reception, an outside antenna similar to a TV antenna is required. In fact, some TV antennas can be used for FM reception. Connecting an FM receiving antenna to the antenna input of the FM receiver and aim the antenna toward the WLNT transmitter. A good outside FM antenna (called a Yagi, after its inventor) can be purchased at most consumer electronic stores. Radio Shack  lists several good antennas in their website (catalog number 15-2163).</p>

	      <p>Also, sensitive portables such as those manufactured by GRUNDIG or the GE SuperRadio are available which can be surprisingly effective.  We recommend the GE SuperRadio which is available on Ebay or from Amateur Electronic Supply: info@aesham.com or AES Cleveland 28940 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44092 800-321-3594 or 440-585-7388.
	      Also, you can improve reception by keeping your radio, antenna and receiver away from noise generating electronic devices. Many newer devices have microprocessor circuits that induce "noise" onto the FM radio band that makes all reception worthless.  Several examples of devices to avoid are listed here: CD Players; Computers; Computer Monitors; Cable or Satellite boxes; VCR's; TV's; Electronic Games; Touchlamps; Neon Lights; Credit Card Machines; Cash Registers; Wireless Routers; Dimmer Switches for lighting; &amp; yes...Gas Pumps!</p>
